Ti-83--Mod-program
==================

Created a program to do Mod calculations for encryption solving.

On most computers this isnt something that needs to be added which is why I made it for the calculator as my security
class has algorithms with modulo needed and the graphing calculators do not have this function.

Looking at the code, a possible improvement can be see with a nested loops

Prompt A
Prompt B
1000000000000->C
While C >= 1
While A>(B*C)
A-(B*C)->A
Disp A
End
C/10->C
End

Tested and it worked.
